# AES-CTR Cipher 

-----------------
##### Kevin Ega Pratama, and Hasandi Patriawan. 
This program can encrypt any type of file. And can decrypt any file encrypted with this program.
## Download:
To use our program you can solely download the .jar file.
## How to Encrypt:
1.  Click "Do encryption" button in mainmenu or, navigate to encryption via menubar.
  2. Choose your plaintext file (the file you want to encrypt).
  3. Choose your key file. Key length must be 16/24/32 bytes.
  4. Create an output file for which the ciphertext will be written to.
  5. Click "Encrypt", them status will show you if the ciphertext is successfully written to the output file.
## How to Decrypt:
  1.  Click "Do decryption" button in mainmenu or, navigate to decryption via menubar.
  2. Choose your ciphertext file (the file you want to decrypt).
  3. Choose your key file. Key length must be 16/24/32 bytes.
  4. Create an output file for which the plaintext will be written to.
  5. Click "Decrypt", then the status will show you if plaintext is successfully written to the output file.

We used and modified **Laurie Brown's** AES Class for AES Encryption in our program, and also modified Util class as a helper class for our program.
